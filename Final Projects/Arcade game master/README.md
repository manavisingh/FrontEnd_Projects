What is it about?

It is about a player and three enemies. The player's goal is to reach the water level and once it does, the game is won.
The enemies move across the canvas with random speeds. The player is reset back to its original position if it collides with any of the enemies.

How to Start the Game?

Open the index.html file which is inside the frogger Game folder in a browser.

How to Run the Game?

When the screen is open in the browser, use the keyboard keys: up, down, right and left to move the player on the screen.
Make sure there is no collision with the enemies, since that will reset the player's position back to the original one.

What happens when the game is won?

When the player reaches the water and the game is won, a pop up appears on the screen saying, the game is won.
You need to hit "OK" to play again.
